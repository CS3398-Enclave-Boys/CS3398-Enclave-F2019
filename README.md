# Texas State Desktop Application
> A team consisting of Charlie Orch, Sam Swanson, Erik Sager, Logan Schmidt, and Mesut Apil.
Our team is creating a desktop application for our fellow Texas State students that allows them to see Texas State University services such as buses, food, academic work, and so on. 
We are creating this application to help ease the burden for Texas State students that find it hard to balance school work and everyday life.

## Status
Project is: in progress
* Erik - My next step is to work on connecting our login page to the web connection functionality.
* Logan - 
* Charlie - 
* Sam - 
* Mesut - My next step is to implement code on the interface so it actually works.

## Accomplishments

* Sam - 
* Mesut - I did the grade calculator interface and swipe calculator graph . Grade calculator is under the grade file in src. Swipe graph is under dining file in src. Grade calculator serves a purpose to calculate what the students grade will be in a certain graph. Swipe graph is the burn down chart of how many swipes are left as well as daily consumption.
